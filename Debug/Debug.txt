Debugging Process

Bug 1:
Ran the tester (32 passed, 19 failed, 51/111 run). Looked at the first test that failed: emptySet_testIsEmpty.
Set breakpoint on line 11 where testIsEmpty is called for an empty set. Started debugger.
Stepped into ArraySet constructor and it was fine. Stepped into testIsEmpty method and it was fine. 
Stepped into isEmpty method and found the mistake: if rear = 0, it is empty, not if rear > 0.
